# dotsandboxespython
For out final project, we had to create a game of our choice. I create the game "Dots and Boxes", where a grid without lines is set up and one person draws a line from one dot to another. Then the next person goes. The goal of the game is to create the most squares in the grid by the time the grid is filled up. Not to toot my own horn but I got a 100 :)
